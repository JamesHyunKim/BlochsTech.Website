                The BlochsTech Open Bitcoin Card (BOBC) is a NFC smart card programmed to act as an easy to use and
				secure Bitcoin wallet.</br>
				The product is aimed at those who wish to use Bitcoin, but cannot figure out how to get started and those
				who are themselves technical, but cannot find a way to introduce family and friends easily.</br>
				With this card all the user needs to know is his or hers Bitcoin address and PIN code.</br>
				Private keys are always offline inside the card and the user does not need to set up a PC or smartphone with Bitcoin software.</br>
				</br>
				Under the tab "Buy" you can buy a card. Under the tab "Terminal Apps" you can download an app for your Android
				to receive BOBC payments.</br>
				Under this tab you can read more information and download the protocol documentation.

				The easiest way is to pay someone you know in cash and have them transfer Bitcoin to your card's address.
				The address is in the letter your received with the card.</br>

				You can also use:</br>

				Well on top of the advantages of Bitcoin such as no charge backs, no credit card fees and reaching the unbanked BOBC
				offers plenty on its own.</br>
				</br>
				With the BOBC protocol your regular customers can make their payments instantly and other customers just 
				as fast as a normal credit card payment.</br>
				There is no extra hassle, the app opens automatically when the NFC cards touch your phone.</br>
				</br>
				Because the BOBC cards are easier to use they allow you to accept Bitcoin payments from all your customer types.</br>
				The customer does not need a smartphone or mobile broadband - even you yourself can be temporarily offline.</br>
				</br>
				BOBC makes accepting Bitcoin truly practical for the first time.</br>
				</br>
				We will also let you keep the profit of any BOBC cards you sell in your store for your customers to use!

				The way it works is that the card will return a check code based on the charge amount to the terminal.
				The terminal will not know how to construct this code and so if you do not see the correct code you simply remove your card.</br>
				</br>
				After giving your PIN code the terminal cannot charge your card again for 6 seconds which gives you time to remove it.</br>
				</br>
				There are also charge limits based on your average purchase and brute force protection in the PIN code system.</br>
				</br>
				The greatest protection of course is that the card is physical and the private keys never leave it. Even if a merchant manages
				to rip you off, you'll be standing right there and you can report him to the cops like you would with any other theft.</br>
				</br>
				For further protection we recommend that you change your PIN code about once a year and use the card with smaller amounts.</br>
				We recommend using an encrypted paper wallet created on a secure system for larger amounts.

				Not only are such payments possible, they are also safe under the BOBC protocol.</br>
				</br>
				Where the VISA and MasterCard networks will probably rely on copious amounts of charge-backs to
				make this work the BOBC protocol has a more elegant solution.</br>
				</br>
				Your card will store Bitcoin addresses it makes payments to. Once an address has been paid to 
				twice it becomes "trusted".</br>
				Future payments to trusted addresses will not require a PIN code or card unlocking for smaller amounts.</br>
				The BlochsTech BOBC card is currently programmed to keep track of 30 such trusted addresses.

				Currently the original BlochsTech Open Bitcoin Card is the only BOBC card available. As more become available we

				If you really don't like it here is how to remove it:</br>
				The card is programmed to charge a fee 183 times - the average purchases per year of a normal credit card.</br>
				If you load the card with 11 different inputs and then charge it 183 times - without actually publishing the
				transactions the card will stop charging fees.</br>
				</br>
				Other BOBC implementations could also have different or no fees. You are welcome to make your own.
