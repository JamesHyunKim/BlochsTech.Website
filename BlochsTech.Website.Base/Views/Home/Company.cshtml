        BlochsTech is a small startup company made up of just me. I developed the BOBC card product, protocol and terminal app in my spare time, in the train going to work and in vacations.
    </p>
    <p>
		I want to thank my loving wife Olivia for all her sacrifice and unending support during those times.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope the card will help all those who are not programmers or very technical to use Bitcoin easily.
